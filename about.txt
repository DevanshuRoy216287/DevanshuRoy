About Me
Hi! I'm [Your Name], a passionate student and aspiring developer with a love for technology and creativity. I have experience working with a variety of tools and platforms to create innovative and functional projects.

I primarily work with Visual Studio Code (VSC), where I write code for different projects, including web development, software development, and more. My experience with Arduino IDE has allowed me to build interactive hardware-based projects, experimenting with sensors, motors, and other electronics.

In addition to my coding skills, I'm also proficient in Blender, where I create 3D models, animations, and visual effects. Whether it's for personal projects or school assignments, I enjoy bringing my ideas to life through design and technology.

I also use Wondershare for tasks related to video editing, screen recording, and more. It's a great tool for producing high-quality content.

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy [Your hobbies or interests]. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills.
